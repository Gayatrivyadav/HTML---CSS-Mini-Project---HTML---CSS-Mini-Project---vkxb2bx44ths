		we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems,
		so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces
		time complexities from exponential to polynomial. For example, if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers,
		we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of sub problems, time complexity reduces to linear.</p>
